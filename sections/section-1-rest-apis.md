# Section 1: REST APIs

This section explores the diverse landscape of Node.js REST API frameworks and libraries, demonstrating how to build production-ready APIs using different approaches. Each project starts with a foundational implementation that fetches data from a collection of placeholder data (such as JSONPlaceholder), then evolves to showcase the unique capabilities and patterns of each framework.

Each project will attempt to solve a different problem, such as GraphQL implementation, but the overall question to be answered in this section is this: what does it take to make a Node.js API production ready, and how does each framework/library serve the API's capabilities?
