# Node.js Collection

A curated portfolio showcasing my Node.js projects and development journey. This repository serves as a central hub to explore my work with Node.js, demonstrating various skills, technologies, and problem-solving approaches.

## About This Collection

This repository acts as a portfolio showcase, highlighting my experience and growth in Node.js development. Each project represents different aspects of backend development, API design, database integration, and modern web technologies.

## Sections

### Section 1: REST APIs

A deep dive into Node.js REST API frameworks and libraries, demonstrating how to build production-ready APIs using different approaches. Each project starts with a foundational implementation that fetches data from JSONPlaceholder, then evolves to showcase the unique capabilities and patterns of each framework.

### Section 2: Working with Databases

Currently planning!
